"Many years we fought to protect our tomb and temples from those who come to defile them. But until now, we've always been victorious. I never imagined that something terrible would happen that calm, peaceful night.",

"From under the stone work of our sacred tomb, they crept in undetected. Lyru Shade raiders they were.

Ready to steal anything of value and worst the vessels of our Ascendants. For those greedy Underworlders have aquired a taste for the for other races like the Floran.",

"Once I saw them looting my friend's tomb, I called out to the other guards and attacked.

We could barely hit them as they leapt around us striking with their staffs and daggers. Fear started to take hold of me as I watched some of them fly through the air without wings or flight tech.",

"The Underworlders were truely demons. Welding powers to challenge and corrupt the followers of Kluex.

Eventually we drove them off leaving one as a sacrifice. He laughed at us as he met his demise."
