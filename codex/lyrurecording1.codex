"My agency recently got word of the Ruin destroying Earth. It's no dought that the Occasus cult is behind this.

The task at hand is find out what their next move is and adjust according. We must not let know the whereabouts of Illron.",

"We got a reading on a couple cultist on this planet, armed but seeming unaware of our presence here. It would give us chance to possibly dig up some information on our enemy.

Not long after we found them standing around a stange altar.",

"For five minutes we quietly listened to the cultist banter and bash other races they hated. I don't know how they got the knowledge to sumon the Ruin from its prison.

However it didn't take much longer for them to notice that they were surrounded to start firing.",

"One of them shouted \"You won't be able to hide any longer! The Ruin will erase your monsterous kind from the univers!\", before I shot him dead. With his companions falling soon after,

we came to the conclusion that these fools aren't worth the pain they brought upon us."
