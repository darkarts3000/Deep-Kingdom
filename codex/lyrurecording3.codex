"We've met many strange beings before, but nothing compares to the natural opposition I felt towards the Novakid.

I needed to use a shader to look at them as we aproached one of their towns. With my skin getting irrited while standing next to them.",

"Though mostly friendly folk, these Novakid had little respect for our cultural pratices. Even to the point that it was insulting.

It's no wonder that our Hylotl uplifters don't contact them that often.",

"Trading with the Novakid might not be as fruitful as the other races. One thing's for sure. I would not want to be on one of their wanted list."
